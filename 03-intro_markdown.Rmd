# Introduction to electronic notebooks in R Markdown {#rmark}

```{block, type='objectives'}

**Objectives:**

1. To create electronic notebooks for course
2. To familiarize ourselves with the use of R markdown and its features
3. To create our initial R markdown document
4. To understand the importance of replicable and reproducible notebooks
```

The electronic lab notebooks we will use will in class will be created as `R Markdown documents`. 

Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

## Markdown formats

As mentioned above, Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. 

We will use R Markdown as it will allow us to create documents that we can modify in different computers (as long as we have R and R Studio).

We will call these documents *Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELS)*. These ELS' will be used to write down what you have done in class, save the results and the commands and also will tell us  where the files you are using will be at.

But, before we go into the super complex part of it, lets learn the basics of R markdown.

***

## Basics of Markdown

So, the idea to use the R markdown file as a E-notebook we need to understand what the syntax is. 

> Syntax: a set of rules for or an analysis of the syntax of a language

### Basic syntax 

In the case of markdown, all the text that is not formatted in any way will be displayed in the most basic font. 

So you'll see that all of these sentences are in simple format. 

In addition, if you surround words with certain elements, it can become a word in **bold** or in *italics*. 

In this case, when I add a `**` before and after the word I want to highlight, the word becomes a bold word. When I add a `**` before and after the word I want to highlight, the word becomes a word in italics.

If you want to add a header, or a subtitle, start a sentence with `#`. One `#` means main header, two will be a subtitle, and so on.

### Lines of code

Markdown allows you to create unformatted lines, or lines of code. In these lines you can add the code you are using for certain steps, or to illustrate examples.

To create a code in-line, just add a ``(backtick)` between the line of code

#### Example of inline code:

Similarity searches were done using `blastn` with default parameters and an expected E-value of 10-5.

#### Example of code blocks:

To create a code block, start a region with three ``(backticks)`. Add the code in the line after the backticks and then close with three additional backticks.

```
This is a code-block
blastp -query q
```

### Lists 

You can create unordered or ordered lists in Markdown. 
To create **unordered** lists in markdown, start each element of the list with a `-` sign:

**Code:**
```
- Bananas
- Pijamas
- Bandanas
```

**Result:**

- Bananas
- Pijamas
- Bandanas

To create ordered lists, add a number with a period before each element. The numbers don't have to be consecutive, which will allow Markdown to modify the list no problem *(Check the raw code before you run the Knitr command)*:

**Code:**
```
1. Wake up
1. Make the bed
1. Lie down again
```
**Result:**

1. Wake up
1. Make the bed
1. Lie down again

You can also make nested lists! Nested lists can are done by creating list using **4** spaces:

**Code:**

```
1. This week:
    - Homework
    - Breakfast
    - Cats litter
2. This weekend
    - Nothing
```

**Result:**

1. This week:
    - Homework
    - Breakfast
    - Cats litter
2. This weekend
    - Nothing
   
### Horizontal rules

If you want to separate sections by a horizontal rule, use three `*` in a row in an empty line:

```
***
```

***

### Links, figures and tables

Finally, we can add links, figures and tables in the Markdown document 

#### Hyperlinks

To add a link in markdown, just use the `[link name](link address)` syntax, where you add the link of interest in the parenthesis and a generic name for the link between the square brackets.

For example, if I want to link NCBI, then the code should be `[NCBI](ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)`, and it will look like this: [NCBI](ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) 

#### Figures

To add a figure from the internet you use a similar syntax than what we used in the *links* section, but with a exclamation mark at the beginning of the syntax: `![Clark Logo](https://www.clarku.edu/wp-content/themes/clarku/assets/img/main-logo.svg)` results in

![Clark Logo](https://www.clarku.edu/wp-content/themes/clarku/assets/img/main-logo.svg)

You can also add images that are not online. For this, you can just upload the image of interest into the folder where your Markdown file is and link it locally as such: `![Local Image of my cat](cat_img.JPG)` using the `Upload` button in the File Panel Viewer in your lower right.
 
### Tables

Finally, lets learn how to add tables. 

Tables in markdown can be annoying, but gladly there are online elements that will help us with tables.

However, lets start basic. A table can be created by having list of words and separating them with hyphens `-` (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe `|`:

Header One| Header Two
------------ | -------------
Cell [1,1] | Cell [1,2]
Cell [2,1] | Cell [2,2]

So, you can imagine that creating a gigantic table is a mess. Imagine creating the table from the syllabus into Markdown?

## R Markdown Excerise:

```{block, type='rmdquestion'}
Create a Markdown page that describes yourself in a simple manner. Use as many element of syntax as possible, like *bold text*, **italics**, lists, tables and even add a picture of yourself. You can make it a very simple resume, a simple CV or just a small paragraph of you and your likes.
```
