# Model Fitting (A.K.A. parameter estimation)


## Importing Numerical Data

* Using dlmread

  + The data must be in a delimited format (i.e. a matrix of values, with entries separated by spaces, tabs, or commas).
  + The data file must be in your `Current Folder`.
  + When using `dlmread()`, the filename needs to be in single quotation marks.
  + Save your data to a new variable when you read it into MATLAB (i.e. `D = dlmread('mydata.txt')`).
  
    Example:
    
    First we make sure the data file is in our `Current Folder`, use `dlmread()` to read it and save it to a new variable, D.  
    Note: We can then check that our data is indeed contained in the matrix D.

    If we want to visualize our dataset before moving on to model fitting, we can use the `plot()` command.
    
    Note: In this example, the first column of data contains the independent variable (\% AP) and the second column of data contains the dependent variable (normalized GT mRNA concentration).

#### Question 1
  Download the *dicty* growth data generated in the Larochelle Lab from the course moodle.
  
  Save this file in your `Current Folder`.
  
  Use the `dlmread()` command to read in the data and save it as a matrix (you can call this matrix whatever you want - i.e. I used D in the example above).
  
  Use a scatter plot to visualize the data.  
  - Note: The first column is time (in hours), the second column is the corresponding population of AX4 cells (in cells/mL), and the third column is the corresponding population of DnmA Knock Out cells (in cells/mL).
  
  * Hint: To visualize both populations, scatter one, then `hold on` and scatter the other.

## Creating a Model Function

Looking at your data, you now want to create a mathematical model to fit to your data.  We have seen two different models for population growth in class.  You may choose to fit one of these functions to the *dicty* growth data or you may choose to create a new function based on something you have learned in another class or textbook.  Whatever model you choose, it will be important that you answer each of the following:

  1. Do you have a good reason for choosing your model?  It could be as simple as "my data seems to follow the shape of the curve generated by this model". 
  
  2. What are the underlying model assumptions?  i.e. The population has the ability to grow without bound.
  
  3. What are the independent variable(s), parameter(s), and dependent variable(s)?  This is where it is important to think about both the model (which will dictate parameter(s)) and the data (which will dictate how you choose independent vs dependent variables).
  
  4. Does the model do what I want it to do?  Before moving on to the next section of this chapter or thinking about fitting your model to data, make sure the function you wrote does what you want it to do!  You can check that it runs, gives the output in the format you expect, and even create some figures to see how the curve changes as you plug in different parameter values.

#### Question 2
  Create a model in MATLAB that you will use for the *dicty* growth data.  
  
  Note: You will want to create a single MATLAB function to use on both data sets.  The model parameters are what should change the shape of your curve. In the last section, we will learn how to fit the correct parameter values in order to obtain one set of parameter values for the AX4 cells and another set for the DnmA KO cells.
  
  After creating your model function, answer each of the 4 questions above.
