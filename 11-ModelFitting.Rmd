# Model Fitting (A.K.A. parameter estimation)


## Importing Numerical Data

* Using dlmread

  + The data must be in a delimited format (i.e. a matrix of values, with entries separated by spaces, tabs, or commas).
  + The data file must be in your `Current Folder`.
  + When using `dlmread()`, the filename needs to be in single quotation marks.
  + Save your data to a new variable when you read it into MATLAB (i.e. `D = dlmread('mydata.txt')`).
  
    Example:
    
    First we make sure the data file is in our `Current Folder`, use `dlmread()` to read it and save it to a new variable, D.  
    Note: We can then check that our data is indeed contained in the matrix D.

    If we want to visualize our dataset before moving on to model fitting, we can use the `plot()` command.
    
    Note: In this example, the first column of data contains the independent variable (\% AP) and the second column of data contains the dependent variable (normalized GT mRNA concentration).

#### Question 1
  Download the *dicty* growth data generated in the Larochelle Lab from the course moodle.
  
  Save this file in your `Current Folder`.
  
  Use the `dlmread()` command to read in the data and save it as a matrix (you can call this matrix whatever you want - i.e. I used D in the example above).
