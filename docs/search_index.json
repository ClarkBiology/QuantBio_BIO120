For our labs we are going to use R, RStudio, the basic UNIX command line, and MATLAB. We will also use atom, a basic text editor that’s widely used in programming to view and edit files. We will use the local cluster called SMAUG (See Figure 1). SMAUG is a computer that the Tabima lab hosts that has 32 processors, more than 14 TB of storage and 128 GB of RAM. Enough to do any kind of analyses. 2.2 Why are we using these programs? While most of our stuff will be executed online, I thought it would be great that we learn a bit about programming and reproducible science. R and RStudio will allow us to do that. With R we can create code that can be reproducible and we can use for future analisis. With RStudio we will have an easy usable user interface to create notebooks like this one! MATLAB will also give us the opportunity to learn some programming skills and get some exposure to another program widely used by computational and mathematical biologists. Atom will help us read files we wouldn’t be able to read otherwise. As we go forward with class we will see some examples of these files. 2.3 Do we need to know how to program? No. We will learn how to do some basic programming and how to use the command line (i.e. how to use basic commands, how to create folders, execute programs and create loops). Being recursive and using the resources we can is very important. Sometimes things won’t work as expected and we MUST find an alternative. This is one of those cases.

The one in the left that says R version XXX is your console. Most of the code goes there, both input and output. On the upper right you have the environment/history pane. The environment stores and shows you all the files being used by the current R session that are saved in your RAM. We will rarely use the environment in this course, but its still an important feature to know how much memory is being used, how many files are loaded and if our objects are actually being used by R. The history panel will show you all the previously used code. Finally, the lower right has the Files, Plots, Packages, Help, and Viewer panes. These panes show exactly that: The files in the folder you are in, the plots generated by R, the R packages that will be loaded, and the help for the different R packages. The Viewer panel is a special feature that is used by some packages, we will use it later. Now, you will see the menu in the top. Click on the new file element and lets do our first R notebook. Click on new file, and then R notebook RStudio panels We will talk on class about R notebooks and why they are important for our course! 4.2 Testing Atom To test Atom, download the atom_test file from the moodle page Open Atom in Applications Use File -&gt; Open and open atom_test You should see this: RStudio panels We will use Atom to open more of these kinds of files that have no programs associated with them! Atom can open any text file that is unformatted, as well as many scripts and programs. We won’t go so deep into these other elements (Remember, this is an Introduction course!) but we can discuss them in the lab. "],["rmark.html", "Chapter 5 Introduction to electronic notebooks in R Markdown 5.1 Markdown formats 5.2 Basics of Markdown 5.3 R Markdown Excerise: 5.4 Additional information on Markdown", " Chapter 5 Introduction to electronic notebooks in R Markdown Objectives: To create electronic notebooks for course To familiarize ourselves with the use of R markdown and its features To create our initial R markdown document To understand the importance of replicable and reproducible notebooks The electronic lab notebooks we will use will in class will be created as R Markdown documents. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com. When you click the Knit button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 5.1 Markdown formats As mentioned above, Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. We will use R Markdown as it will allow us to create documents that we can modify in different computers (as long as we have R and R Studio). We will call these documents Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELS). These ELS’ will be used to write down what you have done in class, save the results and the commands and also will tell us where the files you are using will be at. But, before we go into the super complex part of it, lets learn the basics of R markdown. 5.2 Basics of Markdown So, the idea to use the R markdown file as a E-notebook we need to understand what the syntax is. Syntax: a set of rules for or an analysis of the syntax of a language 5.2.1 Basic syntax In the case of markdown, all the text that is not formatted in any way will be displayed in the most basic font. So you’ll see that all of these sentences are in simple format. In addition, if you surround words with certain elements, it can become a word in bold or in italics. In this case, when I add a ** before and after the word I want to highlight, the word becomes a bold word. When I add a ** before and after the word I want to highlight, the word becomes a word in italics. If you want to add a header, or a subtitle, start a sentence with #. One # means main header, two will be a subtitle, and so on. 5.2.2 Lines of code Markdown allows you to create unformatted lines, or lines of code. In these lines you can add the code you are using for certain steps, or to illustrate examples. To create a code in-line, just add a `(backtick) between the line of code 5.2.2.1 Example of inline code: Similarity searches were done using blastn with default parameters and an expected E-value of 10-5. 5.2.2.2 Example of code blocks: To create a code block, start a region with three `(backticks). Add the code in the line after the backticks and then close with three additional backticks. This is a code-block blastp -query q 5.2.3 Lists You can create unordered or ordered lists in Markdown. To create unordered lists in markdown, start each element of the list with a - sign: Code: - Bananas - Pijamas - Bandanas Result: Bananas Pijamas Bandanas To create ordered lists, add a number with a period before each element. The numbers don’t have to be consecutive, which will allow Markdown to modify the list no problem (Check the raw code before you run the Knitr command): Code: 1. Wake up 1. Make the bed 1. Lie down again Result: Wake up Make the bed Lie down again You can also make nested lists! Nested lists can are done by creating list using 4 spaces: Code: 1. This week: - Homework - Breakfast - Cats litter 2. This weekend - Nothing Result: This week: Homework Breakfast Cats litter This weekend Nothing 5.2.4 Horizontal rules If you want to separate sections by a horizontal rule, use three * in a row in an empty line: *** 5.2.5 Links, figures and tables Finally, we can add links, figures and tables in the Markdown document 5.2.5.1 Hyperlinks To add a link in markdown, just use the [link name](link address) syntax, where you add the link of interest in the parenthesis and a generic name for the link between the square brackets. For example, if I want to link NCBI, then the code should be [NCBI](ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), and it will look like this: NCBI 5.2.5.2 Figures To add a figure from the internet you use a similar syntax than what we used in the links section, but with a exclamation mark at the beginning of the syntax: ![Clark Logo](https://www.clarku.edu/wp-content/themes/clarku/assets/img/main-logo.svg) results in Clark Logo You can also add images that are not online. For this, you can just upload the image of interest into the folder where your Markdown file is and link it locally as such: ![Local Image of my cat](cat_img.JPG) using the Upload button in the File Panel Viewer in your lower right. 5.2.6 Tables Finally, lets learn how to add tables. Tables in markdown can be annoying, but gladly there are online elements that will help us with tables. However, lets start basic. A table can be created by having list of words and separating them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |: Header One Header Two Cell [1,1] Cell [1,2] Cell [2,1] Cell [2,2] So, you can imagine that creating a gigantic table is a mess. Imagine creating the table from the syllabus into Markdown? Do not worry, use this amazing page to copy and paste any Excel/CSV/Table and turn it into Markdown!

Use as many element of syntax as possible, like bold text, italics, lists, tables and even add a picture of yourself. You can make it a very simple resume, a simple CV or just a small paragraph of you and your likes. 5.4 Additional information on Markdown Mastering Markdown by GitHub Using online resources to learn Markdown R markdown gallery of all the cool stuff we can do with Markdown "],["creating-datasets-and-replicability.html", "Chapter 6 Creating datasets and replicability 6.1 Creating basic datasets 6.2 Asking biological questions and identifying measurable outcomes 6.3 Creating a clean raw dataset 6.4 Creating basic (basic) plots in R 6.5 Comparisons between groups.", " Chapter 6 Creating datasets and replicability Objectives: To use the scientific method for data analysis To generate research questions based on our observations To create data sets based on metrics of interest To open and use data sets in a computational environment Today’s laboratory will be focused in the essentials of building data sets. Data sets can be built with absolutely anything you can make an observation from and ask a question about. Before we start, however, lets answer these questions: Question 1 What are the main steps of the scientific method? How do you define a research question? What is the difference between a research question and a hypothesis? 6.1 Creating basic datasets So, we have a bag of candy in front of us. Bags of candy have several different elements on it: The various flavors, the diversity in colors. Some may have different shapes, ect. The objective for today is to ask research questions and create a dataset that allows you to answer different questions based on your research focus (in this case, your candy bag) 6.2 Asking biological questions and identifying measurable outcomes Create groups of two students Open the bag of candy and generate some observations about it. It can be about anything you find interesting or peaks your interest Question 2 Create at least three observations from tour research object and add them here: Choose one observation and create a research question and a hypothesis for it Question 3 Research Question: Hypothesis Using a physical notebook, have a list of variables you think would be directly measurable to test your hypothesis Measure the variables and write down the results in the same physical notebook. Question 4 Take a photo of the page of the notebook and add it here. Did your results answer your research question? How about your hypothesis? Question 5 Research Question: Hypothesis 6.3 Creating a clean raw dataset Using the same dataset, organize your data in a simple data frame using Google Sheets or EtherCalc Copy your spreadsheet into atom, paste it and save it file into a folder in your desktop called BIOL120 with a txt extension (something like data_sheet_candy.txt) WARNING: Do NOT save any of your files with a space or with weird characters (such as ?&gt;&lt;,/’;:=+-). If you need to use a space, use an underscore (_) or separate the names using camel case (i.e. Instead of data sheet candy.txt use either data_sheet_candy.txt or dataSheetCandy.txt) In your R studio, go to the Session menu in the toolbar, select Set Working Directory and select your BIOL120 folder Run the following code after changing the name of the .csv file into what you named it my_data &lt;- read.table(&#39;data_sheet_candy.txt&#39;, header = T) i.e. If my file is called dataset.txt, then I change the code to read.table('dataset.txt') Check your file loaded by using the code View(my_data) or also adding this into your notebook and kniting the document: my_data ## Flavor Number ## 1 Lime 12 ## 2 Lemon 13 ## 3 Banana 55 ## 4 Strawberries 23 In your R markdown notebook do the following: Question 6 Add the code to read and visualize the data frame What are the names of your columns? What do each of you columns represent? Write if your results are able to test your hypothesis and give an explanation why 6.4 Creating basic (basic) plots in R Now that you have your data set readable by a computer program, we can do some very basic visualization to make it easier to interpret. To do so, we need to install one simple R package that will allow us to create plots. This package is called ggplot. R Packages An R package are a collection of code, data, functions and other elements that allow you to extend the usage of R. Some packages will help you plot, some others will allow you to read data into R in a better and faster way. To use a package the first thing you have to do is Install it. After the package is installed, you just need to load it into the library. For example, to install ggplot, do the following code just once: install.packages(‘ggplot2’) After the installation is successfull, and from then on until you reinstall R or you change your computer, you can load ggplot into R just by doing the following: library(ggplot) The command library loads the package into your R environment, and now yo ucan use any of its functions! To learn more about packages in R, read the following link Load the ggplot package (make sure you have installed it first) Make sure your data frame is still loaded into R. Question 7 How would you check that the data frame is still loaded in R? Write the code and a justification Now, lets do a basic plot. Chances are that your data set has a set of columns with the colors/flavors/shapes in one column and the number of said elements in a second column. If this is the case, you can create a simple bar plot. A bar plot summarizes all the information for each category (i.e. The element you are using to qualify the data into different sets) in the x-axis and creates bars in the y-axis where the height represents the number of data points for said category. To create the plot, modify and execute the following code: library(ggplot2) ggplot(data=my_data, aes(x=Flavor, y=Number)) + geom_bar(stat=&#39;identity&#39;) Question 8 Is this an easier way of comparing your data? Explain why. 6.5 Comparisons between groups. Now, lets see how our data collection is compared to the other groups Get together with another group Compare your two data collections and answer the following: Question 9 What was the question the other group asked? Did they data collection help them answer this question? Import their data set into your R environment. That means to ask them for their original, hand written data sheet and re-digitize it using Google Sheets or `EtherCalc/ Question 10 Load the data sheet into R and show it in your Markdown notebook Compare it to their digital data sheet. Is it identical? Now, talk to the other group and start thinking of a way to measure the differences between the two data sets. Asking questions For example: One group has M&amp;Ms and the other has Skittles. What are two features in common these two candies have? Color? Flavors? You can, for example, measure the number of colors for both Skittles and M&amp;M’s and compare them Question 11 Research Question: Hypothesis Create a digital data frame with these two comparison and add them to R Question 12 Load the data sheet into R and show it in your Markdown notebook Lets create a plot to compare the two different candies Comparing data sets When you want to compare between different sites/treatments/types of candies is important that the data frame has an extra column that tell you where these are from. For example: Flavor Number Candy Lime 12 Skittles Lemon 13 Skittles Banana 55 Skittles Strawberries 23 Skittles Lime 5 Starburst Lemon 0 Starburst Banana 12 Starburst Strawberries 3 Starburst In this case, we can separate the flavors from each candy. Modify the following code with your column names: ggplot(data=two_candies, aes(x=Flavor, y=Number, fill=Candy)) + geom_bar(stat=&#39;identity&#39;, position=&quot;dodge&quot;) Question 13 Can this graph help you answer your research question? How What do your results show, based on the research question? Compare the code for plotting the two_candies data set versus the code for the my_data data set. What changed?
