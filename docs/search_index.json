Today you are going to look at three different datasets and seek to visualize them in three different ways: Line Plot, Scatter Plot and Histogram/Bar Plot For each dataset you must DECIDE WHICH PLOT IS APPROPRIATE BASED ON YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE TYPES OF VARIABLES 8.1 BEFORE WE START CREATE A NEW WORKING FOLDER FOR TODAY’S LAB AND NAVIGATE TO THAT FOLDER DOWNLOAD THE THREE FILES FROM THIS WEEK’S CANVAS MODULE AND PLACE THEM IN YOUR WORKING FOLDER CREATE A NEW LIVESCRIPT WITH A TITLE, SUMMARY SECTION 8.2 INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR PLOTS 8.2.1 2D Line Plot For one of your data sets, you will want to create a line plot. The Plot function in matlab creates a 2D Line plot based on the X and Y data that you feed it. These data can be read as column or row vectors or indexed from a matrix or table using the corresponding syntax. Look to the plot function documentation to get an idea of the syntax and arguments that you will use for the plot function. 8.2.2 Scatter Plot For yet another of your data sets, you will determine the Scatter Plot to be appropriate The Scatter function in Matlab takes in X and Y data and plots them as points. Like the line plot, these data can be read as column or row vectors or indexed from a matrix or table using the corresponding syntax. Look to the Scatter function documentation to get an idea of the syntax and arguments that you will use for the Scatter function. In addition to plotting your data, you may use the cftool to fit a line to your scatter plot. The cftool reads in your X and Y data and gives you options for what kind of function to fit to that data USE THE POLYNOMIAL WITH DEGREE 1 After plotting your data as a scatter plot, run the command CFTOOL in the command window and fit a linear function to your data After creating a fit, use the option Fit-&gt;Save to workspace to save the fitted model to your workspace. You can now plot this line along with your data EXAMPLE CODE FOR PLOTTING YOUR FITTED MODEL plot(fittedmodel) 8.2.3 Bar / Histogram Plots For the third data set, you will want to use the Bar plot to plot averages and the Histogram plot to see differences in distributions You are already familiar with the bar function but for this particular data set you will have CALCULATE AVERAGES and aseemble them into a new table in order to plot them as bars Read the bar function documentation to get an idea of how you want to plot your bar plot The HISTOGRAM will be used to plot distributions of different categorical variables. Look to the histogram documentation to get an idea of how to plot a histogram. MAKE SURE TO LEARN HOW TO SPECIFY THE NUMBER OF BINS AS YOU WILL WANT TO PLOT YOUR HISTOGRAMS WITH THE SAME NUMBER OF BINS FOR TODAY’S ACTIVITY YOU WILL NEED TO PLOT MULTIPLE DATASETS ONTO THE SAME PLOT USE THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLE CODE figure; - creates a figure hold on; - holds the figure to allow you to draw multiple plots histogram(data1,5); histogram(data2,5); - these two lines will draw two histograms on the same plot hold off; - stop drawing things on the same graph 8.3 DATA SET 1: Lizard Data For this data set you will use the data file LizardData.csv This is a dataset that was created by tracking the movement of a lizard over time. Import your data into matlab as a table and look it over Question 1: a: Just by looking at the table, what relationship can you see between the two variables? b: What kind of variables are in the data set (categorical/numerical)? c: what kind of plot will you use to visualize this data set (line/scatter/histogram/bar) and why? AFTER YOU’VE ANSWERED THE ABOVE QUESTIONS MAKE YOUR CHOSEN PLOT Question 2: What does your plot tell you about the data? 8.4 DATA SET 2: Dicty Colony Sizes This data set was looking at the sizes of colonies of different strains of Dictyostelium with or without UV radiation. For this data you will use the file DictyColonySizes.csv Import your data into matlab as a table and look it over Question 3: a: Just by looking at the table, what relationship can you see between the two variables? b: What kind of variables are in the data set (categorical/numerical)? c: what kind of plot will you use to visualize this data set (line/scatter/histogram/bar) and why? AFTER YOU’VE ANSWERED THE ABOVE QUESTIONS MAKE YOUR CHOSEN PLOT Question 4: What does your plot tell you about the data? 8.5 DATA SET 3: Tree Measurements For this data set you will use the file TreeMeasures.csv Import your data into matlab as a table and look it over Question 5: a: Just by looking at the table, what relationship can you see between the two variables? b: What kind of variables are in the data set (categorical/numerical)? c: what kind of plot will you use to visualize this data set (line/scatter/histogram/bar) and why? AFTER YOU’VE ANSWERED THE ABOVE QUESTIONS MAKE YOUR CHOSEN PLOT Question 6: What does your plot tell you about the data? 8.6 SAVE AND SUBMIT SAVE YOUR MLX AND SUBMIT IT TO THE ASSIGMNENT ON CANVAS "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
